The host was very friendly and helpful - explaining to the kids (Korean and sign language) as best I could. The theme of the museum changes from time to time and therefore is different from our last visit here (June 2017). There is also a cafe but closed for renovation. The outside garden and play area is perfect for kids to run and explore.,5.0,2020-06-19 10:03:47
